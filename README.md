# Serpent Audio Support

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ZLib-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ZLib)

This package contains basic audio support for the [Serpent Game Framework](https://lispysnake.com/)

Currently this is implemented using sdl-mixer - until such point as more work happens in this
project to move to OpenAL.

The current scope is simply to help further the milestones and add audio support to serpent-demo-paddle.
